                            This website application is for my client Bhavisha Naik, who is the district coordinator for Rotaract Clubs at
                            the University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) and Central Piedmont Community College (CPCC).The purpose of 
                            this webpage, is to talk about what the district of these two schools mean and explaining what Rotaract Club does
                            for the community.
                        </p>

                            Overall, this website will be supporting the community service clubs in the Rotaract District 7680
                            who Bhavisha is the coordinator of and being able to help spread awareness about the clubs on the two
                            college campuses that Bhavisha communicates with. This webpage will also be a way to attract new members who are 
                            interested in signing up and how they can get in contact with the club locally on their campus or contact 
                            Bhavisha directly for any inquiries about joining Rotaract.

                <h3>Dynamic Functionality on the Website</h3>
                    <p>
                        This website will use JavaScript on the Contact Us Page to ensure the user has valid input (such as their email), by
                        prompting the user, once the submit button is clicked, that the information given is correct and validating if the user 
                        clicks okay or cancel on the prompt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is a possibility of using a photo gallery. However I am unsure if I can design such a function. Some sites I have seen
                        a photo gallery being used are <a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.carmax.com/cars/sedans?intcmp=HPTaxTime2020&price=13853-18471">Carmax</a>.
