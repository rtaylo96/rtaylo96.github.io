 * I was not feeling to well while attempting this. 
 * I was thinking all we had to do was know when a user pressed a button. However I did
 * not think about the actual implementation of the calculator and going about that.
 * Next time, I should try to implement actually calculating numbers that are inputted and inputting everything
 * using event handlers. 
 * 
 * I will be attempting the tutorial to understand better for next time.
