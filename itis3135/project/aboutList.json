        "info" : "In the late 1960s, noting the success of the recently formed Interact program, the RI Board realized the need for a program of service, activity, and fellowship for young adults no longer of Interact age (12-18). The name Rotaract (Rotary in Action) was selected to show the program’s close affiliation with both Rotary and Interact clubs. RI President Luther Hodges inaugurated Rotaract in 1968, with the Rotaract Club of University of North Carolina-Charlotte, USA, being the first club. The club received its charter on 13 March and had 21 members."
